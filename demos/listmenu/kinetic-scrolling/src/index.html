<template id="aboutEurope">
        <p>
            Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and
            mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to
            the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to
            the south. It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is generally
            considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural
            and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and
            the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic boundary between
            Europe and Asia—a concept dating back to classical antiquity—is arbitrary
            and amounts to a historical and social construct. The primarily physiographic
            term "continent" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political
            elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's
            current overland boundary with Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), or
            2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided
            into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the
            largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising
            15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 741 million
            (about 11% of world population) as of 2016. The European climate is largely
            affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much
            of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and
            North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are
            more noticeable than close to the coast.
