  <h1>Gantt Critical Path</h1>
  <p>
    This demo shows how to use the Gantt Chart's critical path feature. The critical path is the longest
    sequence of tasks that must be completed on time for the project to finish on schedule.

    Project Description: Office Renovation with Multiple Critical Paths<br />
    This Gantt Chart example represents a realistic Office Renovation Project involving structural work,
    systems<br />
    installation, interior finishes, and furniture setup. The project is designed to demonstrate multiple<br />
    critical paths, reflecting real-world project complexity where several parallel task sequences determine
    the<br />
    project's overall duration.<br />

    Key Characteristics:<br />
    - The project starts with parallel procurement activities for construction materials, electrical
    equipment,<br />
    and furniture.<br />
    - Site preparation and structural work form the foundation for downstream tasks.<br />
    - Multiple installation tasks such as Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, and Painting run in parallel.<br />
    - Interior Finishes and Furniture Setup converge with critical dependencies on both material deliveries
    and<br />
    prior construction phases.<br />
    - Final Testing, Inspections, and Project Completion rely on the successful, timely execution of all<br />
    critical paths.<br />
