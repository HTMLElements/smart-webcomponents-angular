<div class="demo-description">
  This demo showcases a real-time financial data dashboard built with Smart.Grid. The grid displays a portfolio of
  financial instruments such as stocks, ETFs, and bonds, including key fields like ticker, instrument name,
  quantity, purchase date, purchase price, and current price.
  <br />
  <br />

  The grid is powered by a live data adapter that continuously updates values at set intervals, simulating real
  market conditions. Both the purchase price and current price fluctuate dynamically, while the P&L (Profit &
  Loss) column highlights gains and losses with intuitive, color-coded pill-shaped indicators (green with ↑ arrows
  for gains, red with ↓ arrows for losses).
  <br />
  <br />

  A timeline column renders a sparkline chart directly inside each grid cell, visualizing the instrument’s recent
  performance at a glance. The sparklines update in sync with the live price changes, allowing users to track
  short-term trends without leaving the grid.
  <br />
  <br />

  This demo demonstrates how Smart.Grid can be used to build modern, interactive, and visually appealing financial
  dashboards that combine:
  <br />
  <br />

  Real-time data streaming
  <br />

  Custom cell templates for professional P&L visualization
  <br />

  Embedded sparklines to show trends inline
  <br />

  Automatic recalculations of values like total return and percentage changes
  <br /> <br />

  It is an ideal example of how Smart.Grid can serve as the foundation for trading platforms, investment
  monitoring tools, or portfolio management applications.
