The state object is required to be a JSON object with the following fields: 'sort', 'columns', 'expandedRows', 'filter', 'groups', 'paging', 'selectedCells', 'selectedrows'. The 'sort' represents an object which contains the sorted columns. Each key in that json object is the column's dataField item which has sortOrder: string and sortIndex: int properties. The sortOrder could be either 'asc' or 'desc'. Similarly, the filter object contains the filtered columns. Each key in that object is a column data field and each value has 'filters' array property with the applied filters to the column. The 'columns' property contains an array of columns with saved properties such as visible, width and freeze. The 'expandedRows' property contains the indexes of the expanded rows. The 'groups' property contains the grouped column data fields and the selectedCells and selectedRows include information about the cells or rows selection. These depend on the selection mode used in the Grid. The 'paging' object includes the sub-properties 'count', 'index' and 'size' which determine the count of pages, the current page's index and the page size.
