Each object must have a type attribute that defines it's behavior.  Three types of objects are allowed:   LayoutGroup - Represents a group of items (Splitter). Used when the user wants more than one DockingLayout item in a single container.  Properties: orientation - A string value indicating the orientation of the Splitter group. Possible values: 'horizontal', 'vertical'. size - A string | number value indicating the size of the Splitter group. items - An array of LayoutPanel object definitions. resizeMode - A string indicating the resize mode. Possible values: 'none', 'adjacent', 'end', 'proportional'. resizeStep - A nummeric value that determines the step of resizing. liveResize - Determines if splitter resizing happens while dragging or not.   LayoutPanel - Represents a DockingLayout item (TabsWindow). LayoutPanels can have one or many items (TabItem).  Properties:   id - the ID of the LayoutPanel. autoHide - a boolean property that determines if the LayoutPanel is autoHidden. autoHidePosition - determines the autoHide position of the item if 'autoHide' property is set. Possible values: 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'. dropPosition - Determines the possible positions for the item at which a new item can be dropped as a result of dragging. Possible values: 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right', 'center', 'header', 'layout-top', 'layout-bottom', 'layout-left', 'layout-right'. Positions with the 'layout' prefix reflect on LayoutPanelItems that are children of the LayoutPanel. label - the Label of the LayoutPanel window. tabPosition - Determines the position of the Tab labels inside the LayoutPanel. layout - determines the DockingLayout owner of the LayoutPanel. Accepts a string indicating the ID of a DockingLayout on the page or a direct reference to it. headerButtons - an Array of strings that define the buttons in the header section of the DockingLayout item. tabCloseButtons - a boolean property that Enables or disables the close buttons inside each Tab item label inside the DockingLayout item. tabOverflow - same as 'overflow' property of jqxTabs. It defines the overflow mode of the labels of the Tab items inside a DockingLayout item.selectionMode - the same as jqxTabs selection modes. Applies to Tab items inside a DockingLayout item. tabResize - the same as 'resize' property of jqxTabs. Allows resizing the Tab labels inside the DockingLayout item. locked - Locks the size of the item and does not allow resizing. max - sets the maximum size of the item. min - sets the minimum size of the item size - sets the size of the item. items - an array of objects. Each object defines the structure of a LayoutPanelItem.   LayoutPanelItem - Represents a LayoutPanel item (TabItem). Properties:  id - the ID of the Tab item. label - a string representing the label of the Tab item. content - represents the content of the Tab item. Can be anything. selected - determines if the item is selected. By default the first added item to the LayoutPanel is automatically selected. draggable - a boolean property that allows to disable the dragging of the Tab item.     */
